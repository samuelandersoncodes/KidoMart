### Site-Goals

The website is aimed at providing a platform for parents, wards and children themselves to easily shop online. Registered users are able to easily purchase items ranging from toys to educational essentials online.

Our free inaugral and promotional nation-wide delivery ensures that ordered products with the 'paid' status are rightfully delivered to the associated billing addresses on time.

We look forward to becoming the best seller for children's products.

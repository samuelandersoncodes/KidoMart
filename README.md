# User-Experience-Design

## The-Strategy-Plane

### Site-Goals

The website is aimed at providing a platform for parents, wards and children themselves to easily shop online. Registered users are able to easily purchase items ranging from toys to educational essentials online.

Our free inaugral and promotional nation-wide delivery ensures that ordered products with the 'paid' status are rightfully delivered to the associated billing addresses on time.

We look forward to becoming the best seller for children's products.

### Agile Planning

This project was developed using agile methodologies by delivering small features in incremental sprints. There were 8 sprints in total, spaced out evenly over eight weeks.

The kanban issues were assigned to epics and were labelled as 'must have' and 'could have'. They were assigned to sprints based on their level of priority. It was done this way to ensure that core requirements are first taken care of.

The Kanban board was created using github projects and can be located [here](https://github.com/users/samuelandersoncodes/projects/2) Each issue within it consists of a user story, acceptance criteria and tasks that defines the required functionality and its associated tasks to be executed. In total, there were 22 issues.
